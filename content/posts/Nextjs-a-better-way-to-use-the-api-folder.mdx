The file-based routing that is enabled by default is Nextjs Could be a great feature when it comes to routing between pages,
but when it comes to the api's it could become a little bit ugly as your project grows.

Here is an Example:
```
|api
|---v1
    |---resources
          |---documents
                |--- /GET endpoint <-- that's too much nesting to deal with

```

The excessive nesting can make it difficult to manage the API routes in a large project.

One possible solution to this issue is to implement a centralized routing system that allows for cleaner and more organized API routes. This could involve using a separate routing library or creating a custom solution within the Next.js project.

By implementing a centralized routing system, you can simplify the API routes and make them easier to manage as the project grows.

for that we will use `express` and `micro`


```bash
npm i express micro
```

in case of using TypeScript

```
npm i express micro && npm i -D @types/express @types/micro

```

1. create a wildcard file inside the `/api` folder for example `[[...router]].ts`
2. import the function `serve` from `micro`
    ```ts
        import { serve } from "micro"
    ```
3. wrap the the `serve` function arround the express app and export it as `export default`
  ```ts
    export default serve(expressApp);
  ```

Example:
```ts
// pages/api/[[...router]].ts

import Express from "express";
import { serve } from "micro";

const app = Express();

app.get("/hello-world", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).send("Hello World!");
});

export default serve(app)

```
